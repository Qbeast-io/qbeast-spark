    "## Predicate PushDown\n",
    "**Predicate pushdown** is of great importance when it comes to **optimizing the logical plan** of a query. Among its benefits, one can find reduced usage of computation resources and less I/O from the secondary storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a **predicate** in a query generally means the subsequent operators will work with fewer data. Without affecting the query output, further down the plan are the filters greater the benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT A.name\n",
    "FROM A JOIN B ON A.id = B.id\n",
    "WHERE CONDITION_ON_A AND CONDITION_ON_B\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the query above as an example, a potential physical plan, without predicate pushdown can be as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/g1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts by reading all the data from both tables **A** and **B**, performs the join on the id column, **A.id = B.id**, proceed to apply the **predicates** specified by the **WHERE** clause, **cond_A**, and **cond_B**, and finally project the target column, **name**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the optimization of **predicate pushdown**, both conditions are found at the source and used as filters to select satisfying records, **reducing disk I/O** in this way. The **join** operator now also gets to operate with fewer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/g2.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As **query complexity** increases, the usage of **optimization rules** ensures moving the predicate is safe from altering the final output. Such rules are present in all major SQL query engines, with **Spark SQL** being no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample** operators are yet another way to achieve the benefits of working with a reduced dataset. Unlike using filters where record selection is done **deterministically**, a (uniform) sample operator constructs a **representative subset** of the original data **randomly and uniformly**. The resulting subset is expected to have a **distribution** that resembles the source, and users generally only need to provide the **fraction** of the source data they desire to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = spark.read.load(source_path)\n",
    "df.sample(fraction=0.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Its usage reduces **compute cost and latency** as before, except the result **accuracy** is inevitably compromised in relation to the subset size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike filters, a sampler operator in Spark SQL can only do its job once all the data is retrieved from the source, for which a complete disk I/O is still required. Apart from that, there's no clear model to understand the **cost and latency vs. accuracy** trade-off when choosing the **fraction** to use, the reason for which there is a general avoidance for using samplers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qbeast Format\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the above-mentioned issues, we introduce **qbeast datasource format** for Spark, a custom DataSource designed to enable **multidimensional indexing** for datasets together a set of transformation rules we achieve not only to convert the Sample operator into filters so random and uniform record selection can take place at the source, but on top of that, we've also created our own operator, **Table Tolerance**, which given the maximum query **tolerance** it can determine by itself the most cost-effective **fraction** to use, for which the user is no longer left wondering whether the sample they chose to use is accurate for their objectives."
